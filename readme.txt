Data Set: FD001
Train trjectories: 100
Test trajectories: 100
Conditions: ONE (Sea Level)
Fault Modes: ONE (HPC Degradation)

Experimental Scenario

The engine is operating normally at the start of each time series, and develops a fault at some point during the series. In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure. The objective of the competition is to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set, i.e., the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate. Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data.

The data are provided as a zip-compressed text file with 26 columns of numbers, separated by spaces. Each row is a snapshot of data taken during a single operational cycle, each column is a different variable. The columns correspond to:
1)	unit number
2)	time, in cycles
3)	operational setting 1
4)	operational setting 2
5)	operational setting 3
6)	sensor measurement  1
7)	sensor measurement  2
...
26)	sensor measurement  26
